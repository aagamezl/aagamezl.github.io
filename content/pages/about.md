I'm a senior software engineer from Colombia, with a passion for cutting edge technologies, good development practices, and implementing techniques to improve software quality. I love attending technology meetings and conferences and I'm a co-organizer of the Brodevhood Technology Meetup in Medell√≠n. On the other hand, I love reading comics and manga, dogs (I have 2 Huskies and a Labrador), video games and listening to music.

This site is created with my own static site generator, is blazing fast and easy to install and use, please take a look, is free and I'm sure that you will enjoy using it.
